What is sibo?

Sibo is Small Intestinal Bacteria Overgrowth. Simply bad bacteria numbers are increased in our intestinal system and we feed them with carbs and all the junk what we eat regularly. 

What were my symptoms?

As per my experience, I cannot say it simple and black and white. One symptoms and part of the condition can flare up the others and vica-versa. Yeah. Catch 22, like a labyrinth with an easy entrance and no exit. Let's check my list, it's "fun".

* constipation for days
* bloating. You can imagine how ridiculous as a 155 lb man with a belly like an 8 months pregnant women...
* diarrhea
* fatigue
* losing focus and very strong brain fog. If I would have been in the middle of Vietnam war, I would haven't been care at all. If you have the feeling, I don't care, I don't have energy, give me the phone, let's check funny cat videos without a smile. Here you go. You have brain fog and no focus
* depression. See above same thing.
* unable to sleep at night
* your active hours are very late, after 10pm, my energy increased, and I was able to work or play or watching tv with more focus till 3 am. However my mornings like the new Walking Dead episode - looks like and feels like
* mood swings. Getting angry in every minutes for nothing
* Nasal constipation
* weak immune system, catching all the things easily. 
* decreased libido. No flagpole in the morning. Anyone can pray for that, nothing helps. Sad.


* Gaining weight or in my case, losing weight. A lot. If you ear more, all the symptoms above flare up. Catch 22 again.
* You can function till your first meal. 


* dry skin
* circles around eyes

What I tried:

Everything from Rifaximin antibiotics to every natural supplements to get some relief. Not to mention the diets. Candida diet, Sibo diet, Low fodmap diet and you name it.

Why are you shareing your story and what is this site?

First and foremost, I have created this site to build a community and give something back. I'm a SIBO and Candida sufferer and I went through all the steps on this miserable disease. I had all the symptoms, flare ups during my 8 years. I spent thousands on doctors in two different continent and on supplements. I'm not blaming any doctors, I know they try to help but in my case, nothing helped. During the years my condition became more complicated with mixed symptoms what makes all the doctors confused and no step forward. I'm pretty sure, several thing mentioned above already rang the bell in your head. Pretty common symtpomts similarities and even more common, nobody an help you/us.

I found one valuable method for a proper healing process. In order to save money and time, I had given up doctors visits and learn from the others. Listening the people cases. Symptoms and all the problems with supplements reviews and their outcomes doesn't matter it is a success, or a failure.

In my private life, I'm a Quality Assurance in IT field, shortly a Tester and I became a supplement tester. I'm not telling you, do not go to the doctor or health practitioner for a consultation. Not even close. Do it, but it is my story. I did the math. 1 doctor visit costs 200-300 even more + the tests. I have a family so I decided I spend this amount of money on supplements and listen to my body strongly. Very very strongly. During the years I tested huge amount of different supplements and diet and luckily I found couple of good ones which helped and I'm in an okay shape. Not totally healthy, but I'm ok and I can act as a normal person, sometimes with some symptoms, but it's better. Much better.

However it is not just a give something back site. I need your help. If you can affort, purchase the supplements, try it and share your experience, dosage and the outcome after couple of weeks because we can help each other!

Why is the forum?

Yeah, I joined couple of facebook groups where we can share our experience, but it's just temporary. Let's say today you find a good case study and you want to follow the same approach. Find that post two days later. Good luck. I created the forum as a learning wiki, something permanent where we can share our experiences, case studies, reviews or ideas. We can be stronger than this disease together. Nobody is alone, we can help each other. Maybe you, dear reader, you have an idea and experience or a hint  and help me or somebody else.

Why do you mentoned Sibo and Candida?

Two different things, but I'm positive for both. I did the test and I feel it. These two miserable sh..t ruins my life and there is a possibility you have one, the other one will appears just takes time. Or you just didn't recognize it yet.
