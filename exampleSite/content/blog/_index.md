First and foremost, I have created this site to build a community and give something back. I'm a SIBO and Candida sufferer and I went through all the steps on this miserable disease. I had all the symptoms, flare ups during my 8 years. I spent thousands on doctors in two different continent and on supplements. I'm not blaming any doctors, I know they try to help but in my case, nothing helped. During the years my condition became more complicated with mixed symptoms what makes all the doctors confused and no step forward.

What is sibo?

Sibo is Small Intestinal Bacteria Overgrowth. Simply bad bacteria numbers are increased in our intestinal system and we feed them with carbs and all the junk what we eat regularly. 

What were my symptoms?

As per my experience, I cannot say it simple and black and white. One symptoms and part of the condition can flare up the others and vica-versa. Yeah. Catch 22, like a labyrinth with an easy entrance and no exit. Let's check my list: 

constipation for days

bloating. You can imagine how ridiculous as a 155 lb man with a belly like an 8 months pregnant women...

diarrhea

fatigue

losing focus and very strong brain fog. If I would have been in the middle of Vietnam war, I would haven't been care at all. If you have the feeling, I don't care, I don't have energy, give me the phone, let's check funny cat videos without a smile. Here you go. You have brain fog and no focus

depression. See above same thing.

unable to sleep at night

your active hours are very late, after 10pm, my energy increased, and I was able to work or play or watching tv with more focus till 3 am. However my mornings like the new Walking Dead episode - looks like and feels like

mood swings. Getting angry in every minutes for nothing

Nasal constipation

weak immune system, catching all the things easily. 

decreased libido. No flagpole in the morning. Anyone can pray for that, nothing helps. Sad.

Gaining weight or in my case, losing weight. A lot. If you ear more, all the symptoms above flare up. Catch 22 again.

You can function till your first meal.
