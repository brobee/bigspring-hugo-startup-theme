# SF 722 - Undecylenic Acid - self review

Thorne Research is a very good and legit brand for several years and SF 722 is one of the strongest natural antibacterial supplement on the market nowadays. But going back to the starting point: Few years ago my wife and me were suffering very strong SIBO symptoms such as constipation, bloating, sometimes diarrhea. We tried couple of diets, we avoided lots of "bad" food like sugar, wheat, overall carbs, but didn't help anything... I can say, the situation was worse during the diet and we lost tens of pounds however we did it strictly. One day I found this company and finally ordered the SF722 supplements like a lottery ticket. We gave up the the strict diet just kept in low card mode and take this product.

## What is SF 722?

SF722 is **Undecylenic Acid**: "Formula SF722 contains undecylenic acid, the most potent of the fatty acids that studies have shown can be effective in maintaining a healthy balance of gastrointestinal and vaginal flora.*" On my own words, I would say one of the best antimicrobial fatty acids on the market. It seems, I'm doing a very good marketing for this product, but not even close, just I want to mention all the details, why I chose this product.

## **Usage**

We started simultaneously with my wife and took 3 capsule a day. In the beginning we didn't feel any benefit, nothing changed, but if our symptoms didn't get worse, we didn't stop taking it. Why not? 

## Benefit, side effects and results

After one week, we felt some relief, strangely after meals we didn't feel strong bloating symptoms just a lightly one.. It was something finally! I was the one who had diarrhea every morning and my biggest sign was it just stopped. Less bloating, no diarrhea after several years of suffering!

I was in a worse condition and after two weeks, all the symptoms came back so I increased the dosage to 3 capsule, 3 times a day. It helped a lot!

Long story short, my wife was healed almost fully, sometimes she is bloated and constipated, but I can say she is okay. No problem with carbs, no sugar problem. Me.. Well I'm okay, I had to stop to avoid any "get used to it" thing, because my condition was worse than hers, so every few month I take it for few weeks and I can maintain my condition.

I can say it can be a life safer if we take it properly and we are listening to our body signs. In serious condition, I would take more than 1 capsule 3 times a day. I'm pretty sure, everybody already spent couple of hundreds, or even thousands on supplements to find some relief, so... go for it! It can help!

Usually we order it from here: <link>
